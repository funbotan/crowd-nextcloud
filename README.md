# How to configure Atlassian Crowd as SSO for Nextcloud

This repo is meant to serve as a guide to those who need to find *some* wat to integrate [Atlassian Crowd](https://www.atlassian.com/software/crowd) with [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/hub/). Apparently, there is no way to do this easily, since Crowd does not support any of the open SSO protocols that Nextcloud offers (yes, an SSO solution that can't do SSO, go figure). My solution is *not* the right way to solve this problem: that would entail writing an app for Nextcloud, for which I'm too lazy. Use this only if you have no other choice. So, here's what I managed to hack together over a weekend.

You will need system-level access to both Nextcloud and Crowd servers. This guide has two parts: first, [how to setup the Crowd server](crowd/README.md) and then [the Nextcloud one](nextcloud/README.md). Without loss of generality, we will assume those are located on different hosts.
